### About me
During the school time I was good at mathematics and informatics. So I decided to go to university in Computer Science. At the university I wrote a software basically on C++ language. While studying at the university I got a job in IT company where I needed to retrain as a JAVA developer. So I was working as Java developer from 2016 till 2022. My work project was connected with IP telephony, audio/video conferencing and messaging.  

In the middle of 2022 I understood that I didn't want to write code on JAVA anymore. I was backend developer for 6 years so results of my work weren't clearly visible. For this reason I've faced job burnout. I started to find new IT area which I am interested in and which would gives me both visual results of my work and many opportunities of my growth. Frontend development is a suitable choice for me.  

From that moment on, I've started immersing in frontend development. I've started learning HTML and CSS through HTML Academy and FreeCodeCamp. Also I've found out the RS School and now I am here. I'd like to finish RSS courses, create some interesting projects, finally become a frontend developer and grow further in this field.
